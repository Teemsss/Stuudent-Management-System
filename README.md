Database Creation & Schema Design • Create a database called school_management. • Create the following tables: • students: student_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY), first_name, last_name, dob, email, phone_number. • courses: course_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY), course_name, course_code, credits. • enrollments: enrollment_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY), student_id (INT), course_id (INT), enrollment_date. • grades: grade_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY), enrollment_id (INT), grade.
Alterations and Modifications • Add a column address to the students table. • Modify the course_name column in the courses table to be of type VARCHAR(100). • Change the position of the credits column to be right after the course_code in the courses table. • Rename the dob column in students to date_of_birth.
Data Insertion • Insert at least 30 students into the students table. • Insert at least 10 courses into the courses table. • Insert at least 12 records into the enrollments table, ensuring that some students are enrolled in multiple courses. • Insert grades for each enrollment in the grades table.
Complex Queries • Write a query to retrieve the full names and courses for all students. • Write a query to find all students who have not yet been assigned a grade. • Write a query that returns the average grade for each course. • Create a CASE statement to assign letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on numerical grades. • Use subqueries to find students with the highest grades in each course.
Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) • Write a CTE to list all students with their course names and grades. • Write a CTE to find students who have taken more than 2 courses.
Importing & Exporting Data • Export the students table to a CSV file. • Import a CSV file (provided or created) containing a list of new courses into the courses table.
Additional Tasks • Write a query to count the number of students enrolled in each course. • Create a report showing the total number of students, courses, and enrollments. • Use a JOIN to retrieve the names of students and the courses they are not enrolled in. • Write a query to find students who share the same last name.
